DHTML Photo Album

Design principles
-----------------

This photo album was designed to satisfy the following goals:

1.  The photo is central.  It must be the most prominent element of the page.  
    It must be entirely visible within the browser window; scrolling is not 
    allowed.  Do not up-scale the photo beyond its actual size.  Do down-scale 
    the photo to fit the browser window if necessary.
2.  Metadata is important.  Information about what is in a photo, where and 
    when it was taken, and photographic properties such as exposure and 
    aperture must be visible for each photo.
3.  The album must work using a document server as the back end.
4.  The album must be as small as possible with as many elements as possible 
    shared between pages.  
5.  The album must use modern web standards with a minimum of cruft to support 
    old browsers.  It must follow security best practices and support CSP.
6.  All features of the album must work properly on current versions of Chrome, 
    Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Android.  There should be no major problems 
    in minor browsers such as Opera and on old but still common browsers such 
    as Internet Explorer 8.  
7.  All content must be in HTML or be inserted at run-time.  All styles must be 
    in CSS or inserted at run-time.
8.  Album styles should be changeable without needing to change scripts.

History
-------

The original version of this album was the BestFit template for gThumb, which 
existed for a while starting with version 2.9.1 in 2006.  That template was 
designed to take scale the photo to fit in the browser window and show metadata 
around its edges; superficially, it looked a lot like this album.  However, it 
was limited by the hacks required to support Internet Explorer 6 and albums 
built from that template consisted of a large number of repetitive generated 
HTML files.  

At some point after 2008, gThumb dropped the BestFit template without telling 
its author (ie, me) why.  Since working with the gThumb maintainer in the past 
had been a pain, I opted to not try to get it reinstated.  Instead, I dropped 
support for IE6 (simplifying the code considerably) and started work on a 
version where photos and metadata would be inserted into a single page at run-
time using JavaScript.  I eventually merged the album and photo pages, 
accidentally re-invented JSON before learning how to use JSON properly, and 
ended up with this.

The main disadvantage of the new album over the old gThumb-generated one is 
that I can no longer rely on gThumb to select the photos to include, create 
down-sized versions of them, and extract their metadata.  Instead, I wrote my 
own tool.  gThumb still has the best support for photo metadata of any Linux 
photo manager that I could find, so my tool pulls metadata from the places 
where gThumb stores it and pulls lists of photos from gThumb collections.
