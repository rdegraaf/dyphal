    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Renamed to tools/AlbumGenerator.py.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui: Renamed to tools/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui.

    * AlbumGenerator/build.sh: Renamed to install.sh.

    * tools/AlbumGenerator.py: Implemented template installation.

    * install.sh: Wrote a decent installation procedure.

    * I made some other changes, but all the renaming is making it difficult to 
      get a useful diff.

2014-03-27  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.io: Set a window icon that actually loads.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Create the directory holding the config 
      file if it does not exist.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Check for the presence of exiftool and 
      convert at startup.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Implemented album re-loading.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Switched to prompting for the album 
      JSON file's name rather than for a directory when outputting albums.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Moved the ouput of the album JSON file 
      to a background thread.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: When loading photos, if there is 
      already a photo in th album with the same name, prompt to rename or 
      remove it.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Only add caption or description fields 
      if they're not already selected.

2014-03-26  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py (main): Added some logic to startup to 
      detect incompatible Python versions or a lack of /proc/<pid>/fd/...

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py (PhotoFile): Fixed a bug where photo 
      JSON generation would fail for photos that lacked a selected caption or 
      property.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py (PhotoFile.generateJSON): Added a 
      representation of the original file path to the album JSON so that albums 
      can be re-loaded.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Save run-time configuration to a file 
      at exit.  Load it at startup.  Added the window size and UI data that is 
      likely to not change between albums to the configuration file.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui: Added stretch factors to layouts that 
      didn't have any.  Probably not necessary.

2014-03-24  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui: Replaced the QComboBoxes for 
      addPhotosButton, addDescriptionButton, and addPropertyButton with 
      QPushButtons.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui: Changed the icon for cancelButton.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui: Added a new button to install the 
      album template.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui: Added a new QPlainTextEdit for the 
      album description.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui: Added a new QTextEdit to display the 
      properties of the selected photo.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui: Replaced the item spacing in 
      photosList with a padding style on list items to remove the gaps in 
      selectability.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Replaced the QComboBoxes for 
      addPhotosButton, addDescriptionButton, and addPropertyButton with 
      QPushButtons with attached menus.  I may need to revert that for 
      addCaptionButton and addPropertyButton if they can get too long.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Hooked up albumDescription to the JSON 
      generator.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Displayed the properties of the current 
      photo in photoProperties.

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py: Added event filters to photosList, 
      descriptionsList, and propertiesList so that Escape can be used to 
      deselect everything and Delete removes the selected objects.

2014-03-23  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * AlbumGenerator/AlbumGenerator.py, AlbumGenerator/AlbumGeneratorUI.ui, 
      AlbumGenerator/build.sh: Initial checkin of a tool to generate the JSON 
      files, thumbnails, and scaled photos for albums.  About 60% complete.

    * Changelog: Added correct relative paths to file names.

    * www/lib.js: Fixed a typo in a comment.

    * README: A couple minor changes.

2014-02-08  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * README, www/album.html: Removed SVN keywords since they don't do quite 
      what I want: they give revision and date information for the file, not 
      for the repository. 

    * www/album.js: Disabled function call logging by default.

2014-02-08  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * TODO: New file.

    * www/album.js: Moved "todo" information to TODO.

    * README, www/album.html: Added the version number and SVN $Id$.

2014-02-06  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * test/img000.jpeg.json: Changed the caption to include a really long line 
      that will wrap around a couple times.

    * www/album.css: Moved display overrides to the top and removed some 
      unnecessary styles.

    * www/album.html: Added a paragraph to the help text about touch 
      navigation.

    * www/album.js: Added try-catch blocks to the handlers for touch events.

    * www/photo.css: Re-arranged some styles to reduce duplication and moved 
      core layout stuff to the top.

    * www/photo.css: Set the styling on captionItems to preserve newlines from 
      their text.

    * README: Fixed some markup problems.

    * deploy.sh: Build an HTML version of README and install it to WWWROOT.

2014-02-05  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/album.js: Added navigation by left- and right- touch swipe in album 
      view.

2014-02-05  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/album.html, www/photo.css: Removed an unnecessary class.

    * www/common.css, www/photo.css, www/debug.css: Capped the width of 
      elements that are displayed in side columns and moved them towards the 
      middle if the caps are reached, so that the layout is less spread out on 
      wide windows.

2014-02-04  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/album.html: Set the viewport width to device-width to limit the 
      resizing of things when mobile browsers are rotated.

    * www/album.js (loadPhotoAfterStylesheet): Set the photo's src to "" before 
      setting it to the correct value to ensure that it changes.  Without this 
      fix, loading a photo, returning to album view, then opening the same 
      photo again will not show the photo because the load event doesn't fire 
      due to the src not changing.

2014-02-04  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/album.js, www/lib.js: In browsers that are known to not fire load 
      events on link elements (ie, Android <4.4), poll for stylesheet readiness 
      then call the load event handlers whenever a load event on a stylesheet 
      is needed.

2014-01-23  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * README: Added some more content.

    * www/album.js, www/common.css: Tweaked some comments.

2014-01-23  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/album.css, www/common.css: Fixed the footer in album view.  Tested in 
      Chromium, Firefox, Konqueror, Opera, IE8, IE11, Android.

2014-01-18  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/album.js: Added a bunch more debug logging.

    * www/album.js: Set event listeners before setting the target when loading 
      the debug and photo stylesheets.

2014-01-17  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/album.js (loadPhotoAfterStylesheet): Fixed the intermittent failure 
      for the first photo to load.  It seems to have been due to a race between 
      the photo loading and the callback being registered.

    * www/album.js: Added some debug logging statements.

    * www/album.js (fitphoto): Removed some unreachable logic.

    * www/album.html: Set the default src for the photo to placeholder.png.

    * www/ie8compat.js: Switched to versions of the shims with a well-defined 
      licence.

2014-01-13  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * README: New file.

    * www/album.js: moved the design goals to README.

    * www/album.css, www/album.html, www/album.js, www/common.css, 
      www/debug.css, www/ie8compat.js, www/lib.js, www/photo.css: Changed the 
      file header comment format.

2014-01-12  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * ChangeLog: Created a stand-alone changelog.  Populated it from the svn 
      log.

    * BUGS: Moved the list of active bugs out of album.js.

2014-01-12  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/ie8compat.js: New file containing third-party work-arounds for IE 8's 
      lack of support for textContent, addEventListener, and 
      removeEventListener.

    * www/album.html: Conditionally include ie8compat.js in IE to work around 
      some of its limitations.

    * www/album.html: Added an X-UA-Compatible meta header to make IE stop 
      prompting for compatibility view.

    * www/album.html: Made some changes to the help text to reflect the fact 
      that there is now third-party code in the album.

    * www/album.js: When entering or exiting debug mode, return out of start() 
      immediately and enter it again from a callback after the debug-specific 
      elements have been added to or removed from the DOM in order to avoid 
      issues related to the order in which callbacks are serviced.

    * www/album.js: Removed an unnecessary variable assignment.

    * www/album.js: Delay setting helpVisible when showing the help screen, 
      since making the help screen visible can change the page dimensions and 
      we don't want the resulting call to fitPhoto() to immediately hide the 
      help screen again.

    * www/lib.js: Fall back to req.responseText if req.response doesn't exist on 
      JSON response objects.

    * www/lib.js: Convert property names from dashed-lowercase to camelCase in 
      getProperty() when using one of the eval fallbacks, because dashes aren't 
      valid characters in JavaScript identifiers.

    * www/lib.js: Removed the unused function getChildren().

2014-01-11  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/index.html: Renamed to album.html.

2014-01-11  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * deploy.sh: Moved the test album into a subdirectory, rather than the same 
      directory as the album source.

    * test/album.json: Made the description string longer.

    * www/album.js: Added support for albums in subdirectories.  The relative 
      path to the album JSON file is given in the argument, and we parse out 
      the directory and prefix it to other album objects as they are loaded.
    
    * www/album.css: Made colours more consistent between different parts of 
      the album.

    * www/album.js, www/common.css, www/debug.css, www/index.html, 
      www/photo.css: Removed some unnecessary classes and ids from the HTML, 
      replacing them with more advanced CSS selectors where necessary.

    * www/album.js: Set the height and width of the photo as CSS properties 
      rather than HTML properties.  I'm not sure why the HTML versions are 
      still allowed in HTML 5.

    * www/album.js: Apparently Firefox doesn't allow the "background-image" 
      property to be set using JavaScript.  "backgroundImage" works, though.

    * www/common.css, www/debug.css: Removed some unnecessary styles.

    * www/common.css, www/photo.css: Fixed a display bug in opera where text in 
      the navigation links would show up as little squiggles, despite using a 
      0-pt font.

    * www/debug.css: Added override styles for the help screen and description.

    * www/placeholder.png: New file, a 1x1 transparent PNG.

    * www/index.html: Set the initial targets of all links and images to 
      placeholder.png.

    * www/index.html, www/photo.css: Moved table column widths to CSS.

    * www/index.html: Made some changes to the help text.

2014-01-11  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * misc/arrows.svg: Added a question-mark icon.

    * www/help.png: New file.

    * www/album.js, www/index.html, www/common.css: Added a help view, which 
      can be toggled on or off from either the album or photo view.

    * www/album.css: Centered the description in the album view and capped its 
      width.

    * www/album.js: Handled the case where the debug parameter is present but 
      the debug stylesheet cannot be loaded; we'll just drop the debug 
      parameter and continue.

    * www/album.js: Fixed the stylesheet load order issue.

    * www/album.js: Put exception handlers on JavaScript callbacks that were 
      missing them.

    * www/common.css, www/photo.css: Navigation icons use the background-image 
      property rather than background.

2014-01-10  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * test/album.json: Removed all HTML from the footer.

    * www/common.css: Set the styling on footerContent to preserve newlines 
      from its text.

    * www/album.js: Removed all uses of innerHTML, replacing them with 
      textContent. 

    * www/album.js: Removed unnecessary span elements from property table 
      cells, instead assigning their styles to the cells themselves.

    * www/album.js, www/photo.css: Fixed some styling on the full-screen photo 
      overlay.

    * www/album.css, www/common.cs, www/debug.css, www/index.html, 
      www/photo.css: Removed old MSIE6-compat cruft, simplified styles, and 
      removed unnecessary styles.

    * It's been a while since I've made a change that resulted in less code.

2014-01-08  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * test/album.json: Added actual content to the description field.  Removed 
      the thumbnail field, as I don't needed it for now.

    * www/album.css, www/album.js, www/index.html: Added an album description 
      to album view, displayed above the thumbnail list.

    * www/album.js, www/index.html: Added a full-screen photo overlay to the 
      photo view, which can be toggled on and off when the photo is displayed 
      at less than its full size.

    * www/album.css, www/album.js, www/common.css, www/photo.css: Added an 
      index link to the album view, intended to refer to an index of albums.

    * test/index.json: New file to support an index of albums.  Nothing uses 
      this file at the moment.

    * www/index.html: Added mouse-over tooltips to the navigation arrows.

2014-01-07  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * misc/arrows.svg: New file containing sources for arrow icons.

    * www/back.png, www/next.png, www/prev.png: Replaced the arrow button 
      images with new ones with transparent backgrounds. 

    * www/album.js, www/index.html, www/photo.css: Replaced the img tags for 
      the arrow buttons with CSS background images.

    * www/index.html: Got rid of the "contents" div, since it didn't seem to do 
      anything.

    * www/album.css, www/common.css: Deleted and commented out some old MSIE6-
      compat cruft.

2014-01-06  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/album.js: Re-wrote the argument-parsing logic.  The name of the album 
      JSON file is now an argument.

    * www/album.js: Fixed a bug where the warning panel wouldn't be suppressed 
      when only the hash changes.

    * www/album.js: generatePhotoURL() is now used for all links.
    
    * www/index.html: Set the class of indexLink to navigationLink so that 
      adding and removing the debug argument to/from it doesn't need to be 
      handled separately from other links.

    * www/album.js: Removed special-case logic for adding/removing the debug 
      argument to/from indexLink.

    * www/album.js (keyHandler): Added new alternate navigation keys.

2014-01-05  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * www/index.html: Added a Content Security Policy meta header.  AFAIK, only 
      Chrome-based browsers support CSP from meta headers at the moment.

    * www/index.html: Removed inline styles that violate CSP.

    * www/lib.js (getHBorder, getVBorder): Fixed property names so that 
      getProperty() doesn't fall back to eval()-based paths in standards-
      compliant browsers.

    * test/album.json: Added description and thumbnail fields.  Nothing uses 
      them at this time.

2014-01-05  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * Imported missed files from the previous commit.

    * www/index.js: renamed to album.js

2014-01-05  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * Version 3, as of spring 2013.  Major changes to just about everything.

    * Replaced Pseudo-JSON with real JSON

2013-01-08  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * Initial import of photo_album.
