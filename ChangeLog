    * ChangeLog: Created a stand-along changelog.  Populated it from the svn 
      log.

    * BUGS: Moved the list of active bugs out of album.js.

2014-01-12  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * ie8compat.js: New file containing third-party work-arounds for IE 8's 
      lack of support for textContent, addEventListener, and 
      removeEventListener.

    * album.html: Conditionally include ie8compat.js in IE to work around some 
      of its limitations.

    * album.html: Added an X-UA-Compatible meta header to make IE stop 
      prompting for compatibility view.

    * album.html: Made some changes to the help text to reflect the fact that 
      there is now third-party code in the album.

    * album.js: When entering or exiting debug mode, return out of start() 
      immediately and enter it again from a callback after the debug-specific 
      elements have been added to or removed from the DOM in order to avoid 
      issues related to the order in which callbacks are serviced.

    * album.js: Removed an unnecessary variable assignment.

    * album.js: Delay setting helpVisible when showing the help screen, since 
      making the help screen visible can change the page dimensions and we 
      don't want the resulting call to fitPhoto() to immediately hide the help 
      screen again.

    * lib.js: Fall back to req.responseText if req.response doesn't exist on 
      JSON response objects.

    * lib.js: Convert property names from dashed-lowercase to camelCase in 
      getProperty() when using one of the eval fallbacks, because dashes aren't 
      valid characters in JavaScript identifiers.

    * lib.js: Removed the unused function getChildren().

    * index.html: renamed to album.html

2014-01-11  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * deploy.sh: Moved the test album into a subdirectory, rather than the same 
      directory as the album source.

    * album.json: Made the description string longer.

    * album.js: Added support for albums in subdirectories.  The relative path 
      to the album JSON file is given in the argument, and we parse out the 
      directory and prefix it to other album objects as they are loaded.
    
    * album.css: Made colours more consistent between different parts of the 
      album.

    * album.js, common.css, debug.css, index.html, photo.css: Removed some 
      unnecessary classes and ids from the HTML, replacing them with more 
      advanced CSS selectors where necessary.

    * album.js: Set the height and width of the photo as CSS properties rather 
      than HTML properties.  I'm not sure why the HTML versions are still 
      allowed in HTML 5.

    * album.js: Apparently Firefox doesn't allow the "background-image" 
      property to be set using JavaScript.  "backgroundImage" works, though.

    * common.css, debug.css: Removed some unnecessary styles.

    * common.css, photo.css: Fixed a display bug in opera where text in the 
      navigation links would show up as little squiggles, despite using a 0-pt 
      font.

    * debug.css: Added override styles for the help screen and description.

    * placeholder.png: new file, a 1x1 transparent PNG.

    * index.html: Set the initial targets of all links and images to 
      placeholder.png.

    * index.html, photo.css: Moved table column widths to CSS.

    * index.html: Made some changes to the help text.

2014-01-11  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * arrows.svg: Added a question-mark icon.

    * help.png: New file.

    * album.js, index.html, common.css: Added a help view, which can be toggled 
      on or off from either the album or photo view.

    * album.css: Centered the description in the album view and capped its 
      width.

    * album.js: Handled the case where the debug parameter is present but the 
      debug stylesheet cannot be loaded; we'll just drop the debug parameter 
      and continue.

    * album.js: Fixed the stylesheet load order issue.

    * album.js: Put exception handlers on JavaScript callbacks that were 
      missing them.

    * common.css, photo.css: Navigation icons use the background-image property 
      rather than background.

2014-01-10  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * album.json: Removed all HTML from the footer.

    * common.css: Set the styling on footerContent to preserve newlines from 
      its text.

    * album.js: Removed all uses of innerHTML, replacing them with textContent. 

    * album.js: Removed unnecessary span elements from property table cells, 
      instead assigning their styles to the cells themselves.

      album.js, photo.css: Fixed some styling on the full-screen photo overlay.

    * album.css, common.cs, debug.css, index.html, photo.css: Removed old 
      MSIE6-compat cruft, simplified styles, and removed unnecessary styles.

    * It's been a while since I've made a change that resulted in less code.

2014-01-08  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * album.json: Added actual content to the description field.  Removed the 
      thumbnail field, as I don't needed it for now.

    * album.css, album.js, index.html: Added an album description to album 
      view, displayed above the thumbnail list.

    * album.js, index.html: Added a full-screen photo overlay to the photo 
      view, which can be toggled on and off when the photo is displayed at less 
      than its full size.

    * album.css, album.js, common.css, photo.css: Added an index link to the 
      album view, intended to refer to an index of albums.

    * index.json: New file to support an index of albums.  Nothing uses this 
      file at the moment.

    * index.html: Added mouse-over tooltips to the navigation arrows.

2014-01-07  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * arrows.svg: New file containing sources for arrow icons.

    * back.png, next.png, prev.png: Replaced the arrow button images with new 
      onse with transparent backgrounds. 

    * album.js, index.html, photo.css: Replaced the img tags for the arrow 
      buttons with CSS background images.

    * index.html: Got rid of the "contents" div, since it didn't seem to do 
      anything.

    * album.css, common.css: Deleted and commented out some old MSIE6-compat 
      cruft.

2014-01-06  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * album.js: Re-wrote the argument-parsing logic.  The name of the album 
      JSON file is now an argument.

    * album.js: Fixed a bug where the warning panel wouldn't be suppressed when
      only the hash changes.

    * album.js: generatePhotoURL() is now used for all links.
    
    * index.html: Set the class of indexLink to navigationLink so that adding  
      and removing the debug argument to/from it doesn't need to be handled 
      separately from other links.

    * album.js: Removed special-case logic for adding/removing the debug 
      argument to/from indexLink.

    * album.js (keyHandler): Added new alternate navigation keys.

2014-01-05  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * index.html: Added a Content Security Policy meta header.  AFAIK, only 
      Chrome-based browsers support CSP from meta headers at the moment.

    * index.html: Removed inline styles that violate CSP.

    * lib.js (getHBorder, getVBorder): Fixed property names so that 
      getProperty() doesn't fall back to eval()-based paths in standards-
      compliant browsers.

    * album.json: Added description and thumbnail fields.  Nothing uses them at 
      this time.

2014-01-05  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * Imported missed files from the previous commit.

    * index.js: renamed to album.js

2014-01-05  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * Replaced Pseudo-JSON with real JSON

2013-01-08  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>

    * Initial import of photo_album.
