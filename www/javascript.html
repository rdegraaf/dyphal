      <h1>Dyphal's use of JavaScript</h1>
      <p>Dyphal uses JavaScript for the following purposes <strong>only</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to manipulate document elements, and</li>
        <li>to retrieve data from the server hosting the album.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Notably, Dyphal does <strong>not</strong> do any of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>retrieve code or data from third-party servers,</li>
        <li>send any information to third-party servers,</li>
        <li>gather personal information or statistics about users or their usage habits, beyond 
          that normally logged by web servers, or</li>
        <li>store cookies or other persistent data on users' computers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dyphal uses JavaScript to improve its users' experience and to reduce the costs borne by 
        the maintainers of Dyphal albums.  Without using JavaScript, users of Dyphal albums would 
        need to download considerably more data, increasing page load times, and albums would be 
        less able to adapt themselves to users' browser windows.  Likewise, without using 
        JavaScript, album maintainers would need to either store considerably more data or run 
        server-side scripts to generate it on demand; either way, they would need to transmit more 
        data, increasing their costs.  </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, web browsers don't give users fine-grained control over the types of 
        actions that JavaScript code is allowed to perform.  However, Dyphal follows security 
        best practices to limit the risk of malicious scripts being injected into albums.  It 
        supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">
        Content Security Policy (CSP)</a>, which allows web servers to instruct browsers to 
        restrict the permitted sources of scripts, stylesheets, images, and other information that 
        can be loaded into web pages.  The authors of Dyphal encourage album maintainers to serve 
        albums over HTTPS with the following headers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; 
          img-src 'self'; connect-src 'self';</code></li>
        <li><code>X-Frame-Options: DENY</code></li>
        <li><code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000</code></li>
      </ul>
