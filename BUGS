    Fonts are bigger than expected in Konqueror and Opera

    WONTFIX.  This appears to be due to those browsers using a default font 
    that's larger at any specified size than the default fonts used by Firefox 
    and Chromium, and I don't want to get in the business of requesting 
    specific fonts by name.

    Old page contents remain visible when a hash change results in a load error.

    WONTFIX.  Only occurs in error paths, and not worth the effort of fixing.

    Backspace doesn't work for navigation in IE8, Konqueror or Opera.

    WONTFIX.  This is not a core feature and 100% support for IE8, Konqueror, 
    and Opera is not necessary.  It appears that backspace is tied to "back" in 
    those browsers and cannot be handled in Javascript.

    CSS properties loaded through obj.style[prop] need to be camelCase.  The 
    preferred way to get them is obj.style.getPropertyValue(prop), but this 
    isn't supported by IE8 and is apparently buggy on some Firefox versions for 
    shorthand properties (eg, "background").  Chrome does support dashed-
    lowercase CSS properties through obj.style[prop].

    WORKAROUND: This is apparently an idiosyncrasy of the standards and 
    Chrome's behaviour is a non-standard extension.  Using obj.style[prop] and 
    camelCasing property names as needed seems to work on all supported 
    platforms.

    Despite photos being cached, browsers still check the server for new 
    versions of photos and thumbnails when displaying photo pages.  This could 
    probably be fixed by caching Image objects for the photos and thumbnails 
    in the scripts and creating IMG elements from them.

    POSTPONED: The overhead of checking with the server for new versions should 
    not be a big deal, and I need to stop adding unnecessary features if I'm 
    ever going to get this to a useful state.

    Everything gets really spread-out on large wide windows.  It would look 
    better if the description, properties, and navigation stuff were pushed 
    over beside the photo.  

    POSTPONED: There's no clear way for things to the left and right of the 
    contentPanel to move into unused space on its edges without putting layout 
    information in the JavaScript or bounding the width of the photo.  Using a 
    'middle-out' layout where the photo is positioned in the center and pushes 
    things out to its sides won't work because assigning a maximum width to the 
    contentPanel requires knowledge of layout.  We can calculate the maximum 
    width while generating albums and store it in the album JSON, but 
    repositioning the stuff on the sides after photo scaling also requires 
    knowledge of layout.  Bounding the width of contentPanel and forcing stuff 
    to the sides to stick to its edges would limit the width photos that can be 
    shown and may cause the side panels to move around as we switch between 
    photos.  Maybe there's a way to set a max-width on the contentPanel when 
    the album is loaded, set up CSS so that it the browser makes it as wide as 
    possible without exceeding that so that we can measure its actual size to 
    scale the photo, and force the sidebars to stick to its edges?  I can live 
    without the layout automatically adjusting when the window is resized if 
    necessary.

    The configuration file parser for DyphalGenerator doesn't handle improperly 
    formatted settings.  For instance, setting "threads" to a string will 
    result in DyphalGenerator crashing with a cryptic stack trace.  Ideally, 
    it'd just ignore the bad setting and continue.  This probably also applies 
    to saved albums.

    POSTPONED: There doesn't appear to be any way for DyphalGenerator to 
    generate bad config files.  If a user edits it manually and breaks it, 
    then s/he should be able to figure out how to fix it.  Simply deleting the 
    config file will get things working again.

    The directory chooser for template installation doesn't expand the current
    directory on open and double-clicking on a diretory prompts the user to 
    rename it rather than expanding it.

    WORKAROUND: Apparently the KDE directory chooser is all kinds of buggy.  
    Using the Qt directory chooser instead.

    Album JSON files store photo paths relative to the user's home directory 
    and don't state the user name.  This limits their ability to be shared 
    while still being openable in DyphalGenerator.

    WONTFIX: Paths are necessarily system-specific and most contents of user 
    home directories are only readable by their owner.  There's no clear need 
    for users on the same system to be able to import each other's album files. 
    Also, addressing this issue would aggrevate bug 2014-04-07_002.

    Album JSON files contain paths to the original photos and are shared to the 
    world.  This leaks information about the user's system environment.

    POSTPONED: This is an artefact of not wanting separate save and album 
    files.  The paths likely aren't valid on the machine serving photo albums 
    to the web, so the usefulness of the paths to an attacker is limited.  To 
    fix this, I'll need to either create separate save files or encrypt the 
    paths.

    DyphalGenerator doesn't load far enough to get to the error message under 
    Python 2.x.  It fails to load urllib.parse.  If I remove that, it fails to 
    load the dyphal modules.

    WONTFIX: This looks like it will be a pain to fix and it's not worth the 
    trouble.  The version check should still be useful if someone tries to load 
    DyphalGenerator under a pre-3.3 version of Python 3.

    DyphalGenerator won't load files whose names contain double-quotes when 
    they're selected in a file dialog.

    EXTERNAL: This seems to be a known bug with the KDE file dialog (see 
    https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185433).  It presumably won't occur 
    when using some other file dialog.  Files whose names contain double-quotes 
    can be loaded from existing albums.

    Compact layout doesn't work on IE 8.

    Touch navigation doesn't work on Jun's Nexus 7" tablet and in the Android 
    4.4.2 simulator.

    WORKAROUND: The touchend event is broken in Android 3.x and 4.0, fixed in 
    4.1, and regressed in 4.4.  There are reports of it being broken in some 
    4.2 and 4.3 builds as well.  See https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/
    detail?id=19827.  The touchend event works if you call evt.preventDefault() 
    in the touchmove handler, but that breaks scrolling so it's not a good 
    workaround.  I have a workaround in place that calls event.preventDefault() 
    on any touch that /starts/ with a horizontal motion so that it might be 
    interpreted as a swipe; touches that start with an vertical motion, even 
    if they then move horizontally, are not caught and can be used for 
    scrolling.

    Swipe navigation doesn't work on Windows Mobile.

    POSTPONED: Of course IE 10 and 11 don't use the same touch event interface 
    as everything else, because that might be compatible or something.  
    Typical Microsoft.  I made some changes that seem to work when faking 
    swipes with a mouse in IE 11, but they don't work on Chris' WinMo phone.  
    Since I don't have a WinMo device to test on, I can't make much progress on 
    this.  And WinMo is not a sufficiently important platform to put a lot of 
    effort into supporting fully.

    On Android <4.4, the help, properties, and footer overlays don't work.  
    However, the caption overlay does work and its height is set as expected.

    WORKAROUND: The visibility of all of those items is changed by a CSS rule 
    when a checkbox state changes.  However, it seems that Android doesn't 
    re-draw these elements when their visibility changes.  Touching a layout-
    related property with JavaScript seems to force a re-draw.

    PageUp, PageDown, and Escape don't work for navigation in Android.

    WONTFIX.  It appears that these keys are intercepted by the browser and 
    cannot be handled in Javascript.  Most Android devices don't have keyboards 
    anyway.


2014-05-21_002  Rennie deGraaf  <rennie.degraaf@gmail.com>
    Overlays (full-screen photo and help; caption/properties is inaccessible 
    due to bug 2014-04-25_001) don't work in IE 8.

    WONTFIX: This is not a core feature and 100% support for IE 8 is not 
    necessary.

    TOCTTOU in file name selection: files that don't exist when they are chosen
    in QFileDialog dialogs might get created before we try to write to them.  
    The album file name chosen in DyphalUI._generateAlbum has this issue; 
    DyphalUI._renamePhotos might as well.
    
    OPEN.  Pass information through to _bgGenerateAlbum whether the file is new 
    or existant; refuse overwrite if it should be new and refuse creation 
    otherwise.

    The background (or sometimes only parts of it) appear as white in Chrome on 
    Android.
    
    WORKAROUND: Setting the background-color on the html element as well as the 
    body element seems to prevent this from happening.

    Scrolling down doesn't work in full-screen MSIE 11 in album view.  There is 
    no scroll bar; the keyboard down arrow and page-down have no effect.  Links
    off the bottom of the screen can be selected by tabbing, but using enter to 
    attempt to load them yields a blank photo view.

    Photo view is broken on MSIE 8/Windows XP.  It works on IE 11 on Windows 8.1 
    and 10.  It seems to work on IE 9/Win7.

    OPEN: Drop support for MSIE 8.  Microsoft stopped maintaining it a year ago 
    (except on a couple Windows Embedded products) and trying to support it is 
    just not worth the effort.  IE 9 is still supported on Windows Vista until 
    2017-04-16.  IE 10 will be supported on Windows Server 2012 until 2023.
