    Fonts are bigger than expected in Konqueror and Opera

    WONTFIX.  This appears to be due to those browsers using a default font 
    that's larger at any specified size than the default fonts used by Firefox 
    and Chromium, and I don't want to get in the business of requesting 
    specific fonts by name.

    Old page contents remain visible when a hash change results in a load error.

    WONTFIX.  Only occurs in error paths, and not worth the effort of fixing.

    Backspace doesn't work for navigation in IE8, Konqueror or Opera.

    WONTFIX.  This is not a core feature and 100% support for IE8, Konqueror, 
    and Opera is not necessary.  It appears that backspace is tied to "back" in 
    those browsers and cannot be handled in Javascript.

    The full-screen photo overlay doesn't work properly in Opera when the 
    window is small.

    WONTFIX.  This is not a core feature and 100% support for Opera is not 
    necessary.

    The error event doesn't fire if the debug stylesheet fails to load in Opera.

    WONTFIX.  This is not a core feature and 100% support for Opera is not 
    necessary.  Bug reported to Opera (DSK-387854).

    CSS properties loaded through obj.style[prop] need to be camelCase.  The 
    preferred way to get them is obj.style.getPropertyValue(prop), but this 
    isn't supported by IE8 and is apparently buggy on some Firefox versions for 
    shorthand properties (eg, "background").  Chrome does support dashed-
    lowercase CSS properties through obj.style[prop].

    WORKAROUND: This is apparently an idiosyncrasy of the standards and 
    Chrome's behaviour is a non-standard extension.  Using obj.style[prop] and 
    camelCasing property names as needed seems to work on all supported 
    platforms.

    The first photo doesn't load and debug mode doesn't work on Android 4.2.2 
    and and earlier (I haven't tested 4.3, but 4.4.2 works).  Apparently, they 
    don't support the load event for link elements.  The workarounds that I can 
    find online are all horrible kludges that depend on browser version checks 
    and either don't always work reliably or involve polling.

    The footer always stays at the bottom of the screen in album view, rather 
    than at the bottom of the page.

    Photos take up too little of the screen area on smartphone browsers.

    Text shrinks when an Android browser is rotated to vertical.
