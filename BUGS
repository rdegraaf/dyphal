    Fonts are bigger than expected in Konqueror and Opera

    WONTFIX.  This appears to be due to those browsers using a default font 
    that's larger at any specified size than the default fonts used by Firefox 
    and Chromium, and I don't want to get in the business of requesting 
    specific fonts by name.

    Old page contents remain visible when a hash change results in a load error.

    WONTFIX.  Only occurs in error paths, and not worth the effort of fixing.

    Backspace doesn't work for navigation in Konqueror or Opera.

    WONTFIX.  This is not a core feature and 100% support for Konqueror and 
    Opera is not necessary.

    The full-screen photo overlay doesn't work properly in Opera when the 
    screen is small.

    WONTFIX.  This is not a core feature and 100% support for Opera is not 
    necessary.

    The error event doesn't fire if the debug stylesheet fails to load in Opera.

    WONTFIX.  This is not a core feature and 100% support for Opera is not 
    necessary.  Bug reported to Opera (DSK-387854).

    Setting the initial image src to placeholder.png results in failure to load 
    the first photo loaded from album view in IE8 and Opera (and possibly 
    Chrome some of the time?).  Cloning the img node rather than modifying 
    fixes the problem in Opera, but causes a CSP violation in Chrome.

    WORKAROUND.  I don't understand the problem, but setting the src for the 
    photo to "" in HTML seems to make everything work, even through it's 
    technically invalid HTML.

    CSS properties loaded through obj.style[prop] need to be camelCase.  The 
    preferred way to get them is obj.style.getPropertyValue(prop), but this 
    isn't supported by IE8 and is apparently buggy on some Firefox versions for 
    shorthand properties (eg, "background").  Chrome does support dashed-
    lowercase CSS properties through obj.style[prop].

    WORKAROUND: This is apparently an idiosyncrasy of the standards and 
    Chrome's behaviour is a non-standard extension.  Using obj.style[prop] and 
    camelCasing property names as needed seems to work on all supported 
    platforms.
