For version 3:

    * Create an alternate CSS layout suitable for smartphone browsers.  See 
      BUGS (2014-01-17) for more details.

    * Extend or replace deploy.sh to generate release builds that don't include 
      the test data.  An option for minified release builds would also be nice. 
      So would an option to build a tarball of everything.  And a way to get 
      get rid of README.html and any other generated files.

    * Find a way to push the version date into README, album.html, and 
      AlbumGenerator.py.  A git filter might be able to do the job, if I used 
      git.  Maybe add something to install.sh?

    * Replace getElementsByClass() with document.getElementsByClassName() and a 
      MSIE8-compat shim (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13261506/getelement
      sbyclassname-in-ie8) or with document.querySelectorAll().

    * Generate an HTML version of README and install it with the template.  
      'discount-mkd2html' generates html4.  'pandoc -t html5 -s' generates 
      html5, but with an inline stylesheet and a IE-conditionally included 
      third-party script.

    * Reduce the spacing on items in the Add Caption and Add Property menus.
      I tried to change the padding with a QMenu::item stylesheet, but this 
      removed the hover effect.  I can't figure out how to get both.

    * Build a better test set, including a photo with an odd aspect ratio, 
      photos with different sets of comments, a photo with special 
      characters in its name, and a really small photo.

    * Need a better name than "DHTML Photo Album".

    * jslint or something similar?

    * Licence.  GPLv2?  Something similar to GPLv3 but without the political 
      screed?  Apache 2.0?  MPL 2.0?

    * Tool to update gthumb comments.


For future versions:

    * Create an auto-generated index page.  Include a reference to a thumbnail 
      of a photo to represent the album in each album JSON, then create an 
      index JSON that lists all albums.  Have an index page load the index JSON 
      and all of the album JSONs, and display the title and thumbnail for each 
      album.

    * Revisit whether IE8 support is still needed.  If not, get rid of the 
      compat crap.

    * Revisit whether Android <4.4 support is still needed.  If not, get rid of 
      the poll loop.  See BUGS (2014-01-17) for more details.

    * Reference CSS properties in a consistent and standards-compatible way.  
      See BUGS (2014-01-12) for more details.

    * Cache all photos and thumbnails that have been downloaded so that the 
      browser doesn't need to keep polling the server to see if they've 
      changed.  See BUGS (2014-01-18) for more details.

    * Design a more compact layout for large windows.  See BUGS (2014-02-04) 
      for more details.

    * Handle thumbnails with aspect ratios other than 4:3 (eg, for panorama 
      photos).
