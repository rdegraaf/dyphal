For version 3:

    * Create an alternate CSS layout suitable for smartphone browsers.  See 
      bug 2014-01-17_002) for more details.  Detect smartphones (by small 
      screen size?), rotate the page to vertical if not already, and rotate 
      horizontal photos wrt that.  Show properties in the overlay instead of a 
      larger photo.
      - handle horizontal photos and screen rotation
      - update help text and readme

    * Find a way to push the version date into README, index.html, and 
      DyphalGenerator.py.  A git filter might be able to do the job, if I used 
      git.  Maybe add something to install.sh?

    * Script to update gthumb comments.

    * Double-check UI tooltips.

    * Clean up line lengths in js files.

    * Can the arithmetic in fitPhoto be simplified?  Use photoAspect instead of 
      recalculating it all over the place.

    * Move stuff about server headers from javascript.html to README.


For future versions:

    * Create an index view, populated from an index JSON that lists all albums. 
      Add album thumbnails to album JSON; load all album JSONs from the index 
      view and display the title and thumbnail for each album.  Come up with 
      some way to locate the index JSON and add albums to it when they're 
      generated.  Consider automatically copying the album template when 
      generating albums in DyphalGenerator.

    * Revisit whether IE8 support is still needed.  If not, get rid of the 
      compat crap and replace PNG buttons with SVG.  Maybe use data URLs in CSS 
      to reduce server round-trips?  Replace top-level divs with html5 header, 
      footer, main, details, nav elements?

    * Revisit whether Android <4.4 support is still needed.  If not, get rid of 
      the poll loop.  See bug 2014-01-17_001 for more details.

    * Reference CSS properties in a consistent and standards-compatible way.  
      See bug 2014-01-12_001 for more details.

    * Cache all photos and thumbnails that have been downloaded so that the 
      browser doesn't need to keep polling the server to see if they've 
      changed.  See bug 2014-01-18_001 for more details.

    * Design a more compact layout for large windows.  See bug 2014-02-04_001 
      for more details.

    * Handle thumbnails with aspect ratios other than 4:3 (eg, for panorama 
      photos) without cropping.

    * Handle unexpected values in the DyphalGenerator configuration file and 
      album files without crashing.  See bug 2014-04-05_001 for more details.

    * Add a checkbox to the DyphalGenerator UI to make it possible to re-open 
      an album.  If checked, DyphalGenerator will continue to output file paths 
      and other information that's not used by the web page.  If unchecked, 
      only output information needed by the web page.  This will address bug 
      2014-04-07_002.

    * Add a "sort mode" option to DyphalGenerator, which can be set to "by file 
      name", "by time", or "none".  If set to "by file name", automatically 
      sort photos by file name.  If "by time", automatically sort by time.  If 
      "none", don't sort by default and allow the user to sort manually.

    * Support other operating systems besides Linux in DyphalGenerator.

    * Switch to a proper bug-tracking system.

    * Model-View separation in DyphalGenerator.  At the very least, I'd no 
      longer need to make foreground-thread callbacks every time I want to 
      change something.

    * Move the help content into a separate file and load both the help and 
      readme content in iframes on top of the album.

    * A build option for minified release builds would be nice.  So would an 
      option to build an installation tarball of everything.  

    * On-line help in DyphalGenerator.

    * Reduce the spacing on items in the Add Caption and Add Property menus.
      I tried to change the padding with a QMenu::item stylesheet, but this 
      removed the hover effect.  I can't figure out how to get both.  It's 
      probably not important unless the user is using a fairly small screen.

    * Use the photo title instead of album title on in photo view if available.

    * Get rid of the auto-backup in gthtime.sh.
    
    * Get rid of the eval in gthtime.sh.

    * Try using screen.lockOrientation() in small-screen mode, once something 
      supports it?
